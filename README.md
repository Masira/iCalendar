# iCalendar
An integrated Calendar and Diary/Journal
A simple way to have upcoming events and a record of past events in one mobile application.
This way one does not have to buy a diary booklet every year since they can keep an electronic mobile application that is linked to their official emails.
Also one has the ability of using a more comprehensive record of upcoming events, each with an option of a reminder.
